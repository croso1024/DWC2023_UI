This repository contains the HMI developed by the lab team for the Dubai World Congress 2023. 

It includes UI for both drivers and passengers and utilizes ROS2 for simulation during the development process. The entire project is built using React.js + mui as the frontend library, and ROSJSLIB is employed for communication with the ROS2 core system."
